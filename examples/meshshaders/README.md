# Mesh Shaders

![enter image description here](https://github.com/pprabhu78/Vulkan/blob/master/screenshots/mesh_shaders.png)

This sample is based off of the DirectX 12 Mesh Shader Samples:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/microsoft/directx-graphics-samples/d3d12-mesh-shader-samples-win32/

-An obj with face normals is used as an input to the first example there: Wavefront Converter Command Line Tool
-This mesh is then loaded by VulkanMeshlet
-It is then rendered using mesh shaders
-The implementation is the Vulkan equivalent of the 'Meshlet Viewer' sample from the above link
